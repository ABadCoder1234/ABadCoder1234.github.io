<h1>Gamers Hub Website</h1>
<h3>Feel free to host yourself, and make any modifications you want, but please give me some credit.</h3>
<p>Gamershub is a website for when you are bored at school. Yeah, another one. But unlike other cheap unblocked games sites you find on google, this one has no ads, is straight to the point (No unnecessary clutter), and has a beautiful thing I like to call <b>Panic Mode</b></p>
<p>Clicking on the Wikipedia logo in the top left corner will open a wikipedia page without actually leaving the website, so if a teacher comes by you can just click the panic button and bam. You weren't playing Cookie Clicker you were looking at On This Day on the wikipedia homepage.</p>
<p>A lot of games are held in the website so the only way they will get blocked is if Gamers Hub gets blocked. The ones that won't most likely won't get blocked unless people are visiting the website outside of Gamers Hub.</p>
